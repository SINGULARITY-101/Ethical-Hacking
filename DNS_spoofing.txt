SECTION 11.44


*DNS BASICS

 -DNS is a server that converts domain names such as google.com to the IP of the server that   is hosting this website

     >So when you type google.com in your browser, the request goes to a DNS server, the           server responds with the IP of the server hosting google.com and then the browser will       load this website from the IP provided




 -Since we are the MITM, the request for google.com will pass through us first before it     goes to the DNS server
  
 -So what we can do, instead of giving the IP of the server hosting google.com we can     actually give any IP we want 

 -So we can redirect them to a fake website with a bakcdoor or evil code, hijack software     updates etc








*DNS SPOOFING BASICS

-We will be redirecting our target to our own website that we are hosting on our kali   machine server

-Starting the web server:-

     service apache2 start 


-apache 2 is the name of the web server 


-To access this server / the website we are hosting on this server we have to go to kali's  IP which you can get by using ifconfig 









-Now a default page will be loaded once you enter this IP in the browser's URL bar 

-The pages for this default website are stored in:-
   
      /var/www/html

-Once you go to this path, you will see the files for the default website. So if you want to install a fake website or any type of website, all you have to do is just put its files in this diretory 

-Index.html is the file that gets loaded by default. You can open it with any text editor and modify it to load something else
