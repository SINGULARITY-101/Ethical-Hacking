What is mac address?
>Stands for media access control
  -Permanent
  -Physical
  -Unique
Address assigned to a netowork interface (anything that helps us connect to a network) by the manafacturer

Each packet has a source mac and a destination mac so that it goes to the correct device

Why change it?
> To increase annonymity
> To bypasss filters
> To impersonate devices

COMMANDS
*ifconfig- lists all the interfaces
*iwconfig- lists only wireless interfaces
*ifconfig <device_name> down- disables the device
*ifconfig <device_name> up-Enables the device

When you type ifconfig you will get a list of network interfaces-
*eth0- Created by kali when we configured it to connect to a NAT network.
*ether-The mac address
*inet- IP address
lo and wlan0 don't have an IP address because they are not connected to the internet
*lo-default interface created by the linux
*wlan0-our wifi card



Before changing the mac adderess you have to disable the wifi card using the ifconfig command:
 -ifconfig wlan0 down



then to change the mac address you do:
 -ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55

hw ether (hardware address)



then re-enable the device using:
 -ifconfig wlan0 up




Now if you type ifconfig and check the ether of wlan0, you will see its changed
