SECTION 10.32

*NetDiscover is used to map a network and see what devices are connected to that network
*The kali machine is connected through a NAT network
*The windows virtual machine is also configured to use the same NAT network as the kali machine
*Use-
   
   netdiscover -r <IP range>

EXAMPLE
 
   netdiscover -r 10.0.2.1/24

*This IP range needs to be accesible by you (You can only access IPs on the same subnet)


*NetDiscover will now look for all IPs starting from 10.0.2.1 to 10.0.2.254 that are connected to the netowork
*This is the way we specify an IP range for the whole subnet
*Pressing q quits the program 
*Now we have a list of all the clients connected to the same network 


*NOTE: The first 3 parts of the IPs (10.1.2. ) are the same because they are in the same subnet 



We can do this to a wifi networks as well :-

*For that first connect a wireless adapter to the kali machine
*Disconnect the default NAT network of the kali machine otherwise netdiscover wont work
*Connect the kali machine to the target network(after cracking it) using the wireless adpater
*Run NetDiscover for the IP range of your wireless adapter (which you can find out by typing ifconfig)

Press q to quit the scan
