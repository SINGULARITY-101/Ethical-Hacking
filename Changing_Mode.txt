SECTION 4.13
The default mode of all wireless devices is managed which means it will receive only those packets that has the destination mac address as the mac address of the device

But we want to capture all packets within our range

For this we need to set the mode to monitor mode

How to change the mode??
*type iwconfig toget all the wireless interfaces
*disable the interface using ifconfig
*run "airmon-ng check kill"
*this will kill any process that could interfere with us using our device in monitor mode.
*you will lose your internet connection after running this command
*then use "iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor"
*then re-enable wlan0
