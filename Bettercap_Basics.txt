BETTERCAP BASICS


*Framework to run network attacks

*Can be used to 
 >ARP spoof rargets
 >Sniff data
 >Bypass HTTPS
 >Redirect domain requests (DNS SPOOFING)
 >Inject code in loaded pages 


*SYNTAX

 bettercap -iface [interface_connected_to_the_target_network]








*Type help in bettercap to get a full list of the commands that we can use 

*The thing you need to pay attention to is the modules 

  >These are all the things we can get bettercap to do
  >Initially only one thing is running which is the events.stream 

*You can type "help <name_of_the_module>" to get guide on how to use that specific module 








*net.probe and net.recon modules 

 >net.probe: Keeps probing for new hosts on the network by sending dummy UDP packets to                   every possible IP on the subnet 

                net.probe on

             When you run it on your virtual NAT network, you will be able to find the              target windows virtual machine 

             This is another way of discovering connected clients quickly using bettercap 



 >net.recon: Gets turned on automatically when we use net.probe

             You can confirm this by runnning help after turning on net.probe and you will 	             notice that in the modules section, net.probe and net.recon both are running

             The reason for this is because the net.probe sends probe requests to all                     possible IPs and then if we get a response, net.recon will be the one detecting              this response by monitoring the ARP cache and then adding all of these IPs in a              nice list



 >net.show: Since net.recon is already running, we can do net.show to see all of the                     connected clients in a nice list 





*Now since both net.probe and net.recon are on we will discover the connected clients and keep automatically discovering new clients that connect to the network  


*To exit bettercap type "exit"
