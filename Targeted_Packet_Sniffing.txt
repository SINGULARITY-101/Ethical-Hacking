Targeted packet sniffing using airodump.ng

airodump-ng --bssid <target's mac address> --channel <channelnumber> --write test wlan0




*Running this will give you more information only about the target network

-Probe: will show the name of the network the client is looking for
-STATION: MAC addresses of the connected devices
-PwR: The signal strength of each of these devices 
-Rate: Speed
-Lost: Amount of Data lost
-Frames: Amount of packets we have captured

*There will be different files with different extensions
*The main file we will be using is the test01.cap file.
*It contains everything that was sent to or from the target network


*Open this file using wireshark
