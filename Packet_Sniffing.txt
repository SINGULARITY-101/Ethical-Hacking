SECTION 5.14
Packet sniffing using airodump-ng

Airodump-ng is the program that helps us capture packets that are not directed towards us by using the wireless adapter in monitor mode.

Now to start airodump-ng
*run "airodump-ng wlan0"
*this will display all the wireless networks around you and useful information about them
*to terminate the running use cntrl+c


Now you will get a bunch if info about the wireless networks around you-
*ESSID-The name of the wifi network

*BSSID- The mac address of the target network

*PwR- The signal strength. Higher the number the better. Or the less negative the better   (-38>-50)

*Beacons-These are frames sent by the network to broadcast its existence even if it is hidden

*#data-Number of useful pakcets

*#/s-Number of packets collected by us in the past 10 seconds

*CH-Channel the network works on

*MB-maximum speed supported by the network

*ENC-encryption used by the network

*CIPHER-Cipher used in the network

*AUTH- authentication used in the network















SECTION 5.15



*The band of a network defines what frquency it can use to braodcast the signal

*Determines the channels that can be used

*Clients need to support the band used by the router to communicate with it 

*Data can be sniffed from a certain band if the wireless adapter used supports that band 








Most common wifi bands are
*a-uses 5ghz frequency only
*b,g-both uses 2.4ghz frequrncy only
*n- uses 5 and 2.4 ghz
*ac-uses frequencies lower than 6 ghz

In order to listen onto 5ghz frequencies (provided your wireless adapter supports it)we have to explicitly mention it using- 
*airodump-ng --band a wlan0

We can specify multiple bands using the band argument
*airodump-ng --band abg wlan0

This tells airodump to read 2ghz and 5ghz frequencies at the same time
